Well... that was a little bit about me!

I am better known as La Maga de Python, in the last three years I have created that personal brand and currently I dedicate myself to teaching.
You can follow me on instagram Instagram.com/lamagadepython and Twitter Twitter.com/lamagadepython.

Oh! The most important thing I forgot to tell you: I'm a cat person, in other words I'm the human being of Bowie, Warhol and Klimt.
